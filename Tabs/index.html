            <h3> Front End  </h3>
            <p>Front-end web development involves creating and designing the visual aspects and user interface of a
                 website or web application. It is the part of web development that deals with what the user sees and 
                 interacts with when they visit a website. </p>

            <h3> HTML </h3>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating web pages and other types of online
                content. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a series of tags and elements to define
                text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.
                HTML documents are composed of a series of nested tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). The tags define
                the structure and content of the web page, while the attributes associated with each tag provide additional information
                about the element.
                Some of the key features and capabilities of HTML include:
                Text formatting: HTML provides a range of tags for formatting text, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.
                Hyperlinks: HTML allows you to create hyperlinks that connect to other web pages or to specific locations on the same page.
                Images and multimedia: HTML provides tags for inserting images, videos, and audio files into a web page.
                Forms: HTML provides tags for creating input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other interactive elements that can be
                used to collect data from users.
                Semantic markup: HTML provides a range of semantic tags that help to identify the purpose and meaning of different elements
                on a web page.
                HTML is a fundamental technology used in web development and is typically used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create
                 dynamic and interactive web experiences. A strong understanding of HTML is essential for anyone working in web development or web design. </p>

            <h3> CSS </h3>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the visual presentation and layout of web pages. It is a 
                fundamental technology used in web design and development.
                CSS works by defining styles for HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and layout. By separating the presentation of a 
                web page from its content, CSS enables developers to maintain and update the design of a website more easily.
                Some of the key features and capabilities of CSS include:
                Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements, allowing for precise control over the styling of those elements.
                Cascading: CSS styles can be inherited and overridden, allowing for a flexible and efficient way to style multiple elements at once.
                Box model: CSS uses the box model to define the layout and positioning of elements on a web page.
                Responsive design: CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
                Preprocessors: CSS preprocessors like SASS and LESS provide additional features and capabilities for organizing and managing CSS code.
                CSS is typically used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create interactive and engaging web experiences. A strong understanding
                of CSS is essential for anyone working in web development or web design./p>

            <h3> JavaScript </h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a fundamental technology used 
                in web development, and is also used in non-web contexts, such as server-side programming and desktop application development.
                JavaScript works by adding dynamic behavior to HTML and CSS, allowing for interactive elements such as menus, forms, and pop-ups. It can 
                also be used to manipulate web page content, create animations, and perform complex calculations.
                Some of the key features and capabilities of JavaScript include:
                Variables and data types: JavaScript allows you to store and manipulate data using variables and different data types, including strings,
                numbers, and booleans.
                unctions: JavaScript provides a range of built-in functions, and allows you to create custom functions that can be used to perform specific 
                tasks.
                Control structures: JavaScript provides a range of control structures, including if/else statements, loops, and switch statements, that allow 
                you to control the flow of your code.
                Object-oriented programming: JavaScript is an object-oriented language, which means it provides support for creating and working with objects.
                Event handling: JavaScript allows you to create and respond to events, such as mouse clicks and keyboard input, which can trigger specific actions.
                JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language, and is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences. A strong understanding 
                of JavaScript is essential for anyone working in web development or web design. </p>
